# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
The data used in this project is a public dataset available in Kaggle.
Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) was used to train the model.
The model has a special type of RNN layer called the LSTM(Long short term memory) layer which makes it more efficient in classifying the tweets into positive and negative tweets.
